I'm Andrey Ambartsumov, a passionate second year Honours Statistics & Computer Science Student at McGill. I'm curious, driven, and constantly learning. My current goal is to learn as much as I can and pursue my Masters at Mila.

I'm particulary interested in Machine Learning, especially in Deep Learning, but always open to getting any research experience. On this website, you can find the projects that I've worked on, or currently working on, download my CV, and get any other information necessary about me!
