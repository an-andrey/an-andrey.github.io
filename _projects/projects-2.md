Unfortunately, McGill doesn't provide a clean and efficient way of making your schedule, and thus I decided to make a tool of my own. I made DegreeViz, a website that given your major, generates a pre-requisite tree for your core classes.

Hosting over 500 users per month in peak times, this website allowed my peers to get a better idea of what classes are better to take and when.

This is still a work in progress, but this allowed me to practice:

- Developping in PRE and PROD environments
- Handling varying flow of users, while still saving on compute
- Using LLM APIs
- Web Scraping
- and more!

You can find more details in my [github repo]("https://github.com/an-andrey/degreeviz)!
